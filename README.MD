# Hashtable Learning Project

This project is a learning exercise for implementing a hashtable data structure in C.

## Source Files

- `hash_table.h`: Header file containing the hashtable data structure and function prototypes.
- `hash_table.c`: Source file containing the implementation of the hashtable functions.
- `main.c`: Source file containing the main program to test the hashtable implementation.

## Build Directory

The `build` directory contains the compiled executable `main.exe`.

## Running the Program

To compile and run the program, execute the `run.sh` script:
    
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

    
This will compile the source files and run the resulting executable.

## TODO

- [ ] Add error handling to input validation.
- [ ] Implement resizing of the hashtable to improve performance.
- [ ] Write unit tests to validate hashtable functionality.
- [ ] Add support for more data types in the hashtable.
